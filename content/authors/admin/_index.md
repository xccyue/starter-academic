Hi, I am Chaoyue Xing, a passionate undergraduate student who has learned various tools in data mining and machine learning and eager to put my knowledge into practice. I spent the first two years of my college life at Shandong University which equipped me with solid programming and mathematics skills. Iâ€™m currently undertaking the honours year of my Bachelor degree, and my project is mainly about the 3D dance generation conditioned on music.
